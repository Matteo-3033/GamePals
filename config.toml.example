# This file is an example of the configuration file for Copilot
# The configuration file is used to define how each input is mapped to the controller and how the inputs are merged
# The file is divided into two sections: AssistanceLevels and PolicyTypes
# - The AssistanceLevels section is used to define how much help the human player (using a physical controller) will receive. Set the value to 1.0 for full assistance and 0.0 for no assistance
#   This section can be repeated to define the assistance levels for multiple human players
# - The PolicyTypes section is used to define how the inputs are merged. Refer to command_arbitrator/policies for details on the available merging policies
